# Hyperiondev_Data_Science_Skills_Bootcamp
Coding Projects created from the Hyperiondev Data Science Bootcamp

## Description of the project

* **What is this project?**
The python applications in this folder represent the main python coding challenges created during the Hyperiondev Data Science Skills Bootcamp course.

* **How does it work?**
Most of the applications are standalone python files that can be run independently. There are some where there is an accompanying data file saved in
the same drive that would need to be placed in the same folder as the application file to run.

* **Who will use this project?**
Anybody who would like to view the python code created on this course.

* **What is the goal of this project?** 
The goal is to give the reader a sense of the python coding applications created on the course and to have an online record of the python code created.



## Table of contents

**1.Logical Operators - Award**
A program that determines the award a person competing a triathlon will receive using if, elif, else statements.

**2.Capstone Project - Finance Calculators**
A program that enables the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

**3.Control Structures - While Loops**
Programs that perform calculations using While loops.

**4.Control Structures - For Loops**

**5.String Handling - Alternative Words**
Programs that create upper and lower alternative letters and alternative words.

**6.Data Structure Lists and Dictionaries - Cafe**
A program that calculates the total stock worth in a cafe based on a menu list and stock and price dictionaries.

**7.Functions - Holiday**
A program that will calculate a user's total holiday cost (plane cost, hotel cost and car-rental cost)

**8.Supervised Learning Linear Regression - Insurance Regression**
A program that plots a scatter plot on insurance data, implements a line of best fit and predicts values based on the regression.

**9.Semantic Similarity - Movies and Semantic**
A program that creates a function to return which movie a user would watch next if they watched "Planet Hulk" and a function that measures the similarity between words.

**10.Capstone Project - NLP Applications sentiment analysis**
A program that performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of product reviews from Amazon.



## Instructions for how to develop, use, and test the code.
Each application can be run from program managers such as VSCode or Jupyter Notebook.
